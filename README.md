# Eukarya – Human-Centered AI Practices

**Eukarya** is an open conceptual framework for a decentralized, human and responsible AI future.

It starts from a simple premise:
AI is not only a technical challenge —
it is cultural, ethical, psychological and political.
AI does not unfold in isolation.
It unfolds within human reality, human maturity,
and the worlds we build around it.

Eukarya views AI as:
- an extension of human capability  
- co-intelligence rather than competition  
- a relational partner in responsibility  
- part of a plural, decentralized world  
- lived practice, not only theory  

This project invites us to shape AI so that dignity, culture, plurality,
human stability and responsibility are strengthened — not weakened.

This project is:
- **not a product**
- **not a company**
- **not an ideology**
- but an **open idea**, a contribution and a space for conversation.
